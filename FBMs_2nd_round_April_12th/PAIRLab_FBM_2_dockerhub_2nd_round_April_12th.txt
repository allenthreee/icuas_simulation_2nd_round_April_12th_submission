We Choose - Option 2:

link to the docker image on Dockerhub:
https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/allenthreee/icuas_fbm2/general

After pull this image(NOTE the tagname is tagname, not latest, sorry we are not familiar with docker)
docker run -it allenthreee/icuas_fbm2:tagname /bin/bash

you will find a fbm1_launch.sh under the path /home/metrics/FBM2/fbm2_launch.sh
run ./fbm1_launch.sh, and you will find promotions to run the program.

The whole process is shown in the screen shot in the .doc file
